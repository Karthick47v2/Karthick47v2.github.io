- [Mock-Buddy](https://github.com/Karthick47v2/mock-buddy), a web application that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to help users overcome stage fear and improve public speaking and presentation skills with real-time feedback. The application provides real-time feedback on facial expressions, body language, and voice modulation to help users become more confident and effective speakers.
- [Quizzzy](https://github.com/Karthick47v2/quizzzy), a mobile application that uses Transformers to automatically generate multiple choice questions from context of textbooks. This provides fast and efficient way for students and teachers to self-evaluate and assess understanding, making it an ideal study tool.
- [trAIner](https://github.com/Karthick47v2/trAIner), a mobile application that uses pose estimation to monitor user's activity during workout and provide real-time feedback on the correct form and technique. It helps users to perform exercises correctly and avoid injury, while also improving their overall workout experience.

- [hard-hat-detection](https://github.com/Karthick47v2/hard-hat-detection), a system that uses object detection model using deep learning to detect the presence of hard hats in images & videos, specifically for embedded systems. This model can be used to improve safety in construction sites by automatically identifying workers who are not wearing hard hats and alerting supervisors.
